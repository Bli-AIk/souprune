## ü•£ Introduction

Hey, don‚Äôt be scared by that **‚ÄúRust‚Äù** badge above ‚Äî **SoupRune isn‚Äôt just a niche tool for hardcore programmers!**

It supports **Gamemaker**, **[Unitale](https://github.com/lvk/Unitale) / [Create Your Frisk](https://github.com/RhenaudTheLukark/CreateYourFrisk)**, and the **.NET (C#)** ecosystem.

Whether you‚Äôre used to coding in GML, scripting in Lua, or developing in Unity / Godot, you may find something familiar here.

**And the ‚ÄúRune‚Äù in the name isn‚Äôt random either ‚Äî**

While the Undertale fangame framework space may already be saturated, the Deltarune community is thriving.

SoupRune was created to seize this opportunity as a fangame framework, ~~while also serving as a spiritual successor to [Undertale Changer Template](https://github.com/Bli-AIk/Undertale-Changer-Template)~~.

But that doesn‚Äôt mean SoupRune is only a Deltarune framework ‚Äî we also value support for Undertale fangames!

SoupRune aims to become a true **‚Äúcommunity-oriented fangame framework‚Äù** ‚Äî open, flexible, modern, yet still retaining that familiar DR / UT style.
